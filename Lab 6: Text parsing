Once on a time and twice on a time, and all times together as ever I heard tell of,
there was a tiny lassie who would weep all day to have the stars in the sky to play with;

# Word and Character Count (List)

# Split the text into words using split()
words_list = text.split()

# Count words and characters
word_count = len(words_list)

print("Word Count:", word_count)
print("Character Count:", char_count)

# Create a histogram (word frequency) using Counter
word_frequencies_list = Counter(words_list)

print("\nWord Frequency (List-based count):")

    print(f"{word}: {freq}")

# Repeat with a Dictionary

# Using a dictionary to count manually
word_freq_dict = {}

for word in words_list:
    word = word.lower().strip(",.!?;:-()[]")

# Regular Expressions for Data Extraction

# Extract phone numbers and emails using regex

# Combine extracted data into one list
extracted_data = phone_numbers + emails

# Email Username Processing

# Extract usernames (before @)
usernames = [email.split('@')[0] for email in emails]

# Append @hotmail.com to each username
hotmail_emails = [user + "@hotmail.com" for user in usernames]

print("\nGenerated Hotmail Addresses:")
