# Printing Statements

# Print lines of a famous quote using multiple print() statements
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")

# Print the same quote in a single statement with newline characters
print("All the world's a stage, \nAnd all the men and women merely players: \nThey have their exits and their entrances; \nAnd one man in his time plays many parts, \nHis acts being seven ages.")

# Print IP address-like numbers with custom separator
print("127", "0", "0", "1", sep=".")

# Simulating a Loading Process

import time

# Loop to simulate a loading process with flush=True to immediately print
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Loading... {i+1}", flush=True)
    time.sleep(1)  # Pause for 1 second

# Print a final statement that is immediately flushed
print("This is immediately flushed.", flush=True)
